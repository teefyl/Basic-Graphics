X-Translates along X axis(moves right)

C-Translates along Y axis(moves down)

V-Translates along Y axis(moves up)

B- Translates along Z axis(-.1)

N-Translates along Z axis(+.1)

K-Uniform Scaling Larger

L-Uniform Scaling Smaller

O-Non Uniform Scaling Larger

P-Non Uniform Scaling Smaller

I- Multiple Transformations- Scales down and rotates along X axis

Lab 3 - Perspectives

Lab 4 - Hierarchy 

Note: These are just lab mains, and can be quite meaningless without the attached files or headers, they're purely for my own use.
